# Abstract

This REP updates the specification of the ROS distribution files
facilitated in the building, packaging, testing and documenting process.

The intention is to separate the buildfarm related configuration options
from the information describing the ROS packages and
repositories[^1][^2].

This REP is a revised version of REP 141[^3]. It currently does not
repeat the content of REP 141 but only states the differences.

# Specification

## Index file

- distributions
  - distribution: list of reference to the distribution files A single
    distribution file guarantees that there are no duplicate
    repositories and is therefore preferred. But when running a custom
    buildfarm which only adds custom repositories it is much smoother to
    maintain them in a separate file to avoid any kind of conflicts.

    The files are read in the order they are listed and entries in later
    distribution files are overwriting entries from previous
    distribution files. This can be used to override specific
    repositories with either a forked variant or a specific version
    number. `bloom` will create pull requests against the last
    distribution file since even when the repository is present in any
    of the other distribution files the \"overlaying\" version should be
    stored in the last one.

  - release_builds / source_builds / doc_builds: are being removed since
    they only contain information relevant to the buildfarm
- version: version number, this REP describes version 3 (instead of
  version 2 described in REP 141[^4] and version 1 described in REP
  137[^5])

## Distribution file

- repositories
  - source
    - test_commits: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each
      commit to the branch specified under `versions`. (default: false)
    - test_pull_requests: a boolean flag used to enable CI jobs for each
      pull request against the branch specified under `version`.
      (default: false)
    - version: if `test_pull_requests` is enabled the version must
      specify a branch.
- tags: list of tag names to identify the group of repositories
  specified by the distribution file. It allows build files to refer to
  sets of repositories / packages based on in which distribution file
  they are defined.
- version: version number, this REP describes version 2 (instead of
  version 1 described in REP 141[^6] and REP 137[^7])

## Reference implementation

This REP is to be implemented in version 0.4 of the Python package
*rosdistro*. It will serve as a reference implementation for this REP. A
draft implementation can be found in[^8].

# Compatibility issues

The draft implementation of rosdistro is able to parse both index format
version 2 as well as 3.

To leverage the new ability to list multiple distribution files the
following additional API will be introduced:

- rosdistro.get_distribution_files()

The existing API (\'rosdistro.get_distribution_file()\') will continue
to provide the correct data by merging the information from all
distribution files.

All function related to the removed build files will simply return empty
lists.

As soon as the new version of \'rosdistro\' is released the
\'ros/rosdistro\' repository[^9] is being updated to the new format (for
Hydro and higher). Any client accessing trying to access the data with
an old \'rosdistro\' version will get an error message like this:

    Unable to handle 'index' format version '3', please update rosdistro...

## Affected tools

The only tool beside the \"old\" buildfarm accessing the raw rosdistro
data which needs to be updated is \'rosdep\'[^10].

All other tools using the API of rosdistro (even if deprecated) will
continue to work.

In order to allow releasing packages into rosdistro repositories with
multiple distribution files \'bloom\' will need to be updated[^11].
